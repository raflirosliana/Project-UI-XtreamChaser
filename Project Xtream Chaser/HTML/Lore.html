                <h2>Set</h2>
                In the years of the Sengoku Era (around 1450 AD), Japan was involved in an endless conflict. The fires of war was raged on, spreading deep into the mountains, the forest, even to the wasteland in nowhere. Local Daimyo, Seijin Takagawa, staged a bloody
                coup and wrested control of the land. In a bloody combat, he defeated General Akihito (The Military General of Shogun Keinichi Serizawa), and it seemed like the war might finally be over. The Sengoku Era was a century-long period in Japanese
                history that was known for its military conflict among social and political. Warlords ruled, and of the country's leaders fought each other in a never-ending battle to claim both power and land. This was also the era known as the Middle
                Ages of Japan, and the more medieval setting allowed for the impression that various ancient and mystical elements still exist in the world.

                <h2>Story</h2>
                XTream Chaser IV : The Daimyo Revenge is a story driven open world game. An anthology of stories surrounds Main Story in the form of Side Story. The year is 1450 AD. <br>You wil play as a Samurai, a disgraced and disfigured warrior rescued
                from the brink of death. Bound to protect a young Daimyo who is the descendant of an ancient bloodline, you become the target of many vicious enemies, including the dangerous Mizuo Shinobi Clan. When the young lord is captured, nothing
                will stop you on a perilous quest to regain your honor, not even death itself. <br> Samurai warriors are the legendary defenders of Japan until the end of the Sengoku Era, Daimyo and Shogun invades the land of Japan, wreaking havoc and
                conquering the local population. As one of the last surviving samurai, players rise from the ashes to fight back. But, honorable tactics won't lead to victory. They must move beyond their samurai traditions to forge a new way of fighting
                the way of the Shinobi as they wage an unconventional war for the freedom of Japan.
